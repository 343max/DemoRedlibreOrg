This is the code that makes up demo.redlibre.org. This is developed by me, by kind permission from redlibre.org, so if it's broken, then don't blame redlibre.org. :) To install it, get a debian lenny server (I got one at rackspace and can recommend them), run (for some reason apt-get update fails the first time for me):

 * apt-get update
 * apt-get upgrade
 * apt-get update
 * apt-get upgrade
 * apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php

All of this, as well as what follows, has to be run as root, or with 'sudo' in front of it, obviously. Now run a2enmod to install the following modules:

 * a2enmod mod_headers
 * a2enmod mod_dav
 * a2enmod mod_dav_fs

Now run the following from this directory:

 * mv apache2.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
 * mv * /var/www
 * chown -R www-data /var/www
 * /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
